Task:
    1. Design simple physics engine and simulate fishnet behavior from the calm state.

General instructions: 
    1. Work out the effect of gravity on the array of nodes with mass.
    2. For simplicity introduce the attraction and repulsive forces between nodes(interaction of the electric of gravitational nature).
    3. Keep the model of physics law as simple as possible.
Constraints:
    1. Programming tools: C/C++/WinAPI, OpenGL.
    2. Don't use third-party engines and frameworks like Bullet.
    3. Visual simulation should run smoothly, frame rate >= 25fps.
    4. Result: zip archive with source code, with all required project libraries and compiled executable file.
Expected operation sequence:
    1. User drag one node of fishnet with mouse.
    2. One release fishnet begin to sway in natural manner.
